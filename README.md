# Q1. Grade Calculator

This simple C# program calculates the letter grade based on a numerical input between 0 and 100.

## Usage

# CD INTO THE GRADECALCULATOR AND DO THE FOLLOWING
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Compile and run the `GradeCalculator.cs` file.
4. Enter a numerical grade when prompted.
5. The program will display the corresponding letter grade.

## How it works

- The program prompts the user to input a numerical grade between 0 and 100.
- It checks if the input is valid and within the specified range.
- If the input is valid, it calculates and displays the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
- If the input is not valid or outside the range, it prompts the user to enter a valid numerical grade.

# Q2. Ticket Price Calculator

This simple C# program calculates the ticket price based on the age entered by the user.

## Usage

# CD INTO THE TICKETPRICECALCULATOR AND DO THE FOLLOWING
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Compile and run the `TicketPriceCalculator.cs` file.
4. Enter your age when prompted.
5. The program will display the corresponding ticket price.

## How it works

- The program prompts the user to enter their age.
- It checks if the input is valid and interprets it as an integer.
- If the input is valid, it calculates and displays the ticket price based on the age:
  - Children aged 12 or below and seniors aged 65 or above pay a discounted price of GHC 7.
  - Adults aged 13 to 64 pay the regular price of GHC 10.
- If the input is not valid, it prompts the user to enter a valid age.

# Q3. Triangle Type Identifier

This simple C# program identifies the type of triangle based on the lengths of its sides.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Compile and run the `TriangleTypeIdentifier.cs` file.
4. Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle when prompted.
5. The program will determine and display the type of triangle.

## How it works

- The program prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
- It checks if the inputs are valid numerical values.
- If the inputs are valid, it determines the type of triangle based on the side lengths:
  - If all three sides are equal, it's an equilateral triangle.
  - If two sides are equal, it's an isosceles triangle.
  - Otherwise, it's a scalene triangle.
- If the inputs are not valid, it prompts the user to enter valid numerical values.
